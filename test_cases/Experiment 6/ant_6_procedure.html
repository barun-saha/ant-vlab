	<td>â€¢ 802.16m (New) The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is expected this year in 2011 to provide final approval for the 802.16m standard, also known as &quot;WiMAX 2&quot; [iii] . However it plans on testing out 802.16m sometime next year in the hopes of deploying it in 2012.</td>

	<td>When a user sends data from one location to another, the wireless connection is transferred from one cell to another cell. When signal transmit form user to WiMAX base station or base station to user (WiMAX receiver), the wireless channel faces many attenuation such as fraction, reflection, refraction, wall obstruction etc. These all attenuation may cause of distorted, and split toward multi path. The target of WiMAX receiver is to rebuild the transmitted data perfectly to make possible reliable data transmission.</td>
