	<td>A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a wireless network consisting of spatially distributed autonomous devices that use sensors for monitoring and recording the physical conditions of the environment and organizing the collected data at a central location. WSNs measure environmental conditions like temperature, sound, pollution levels, humidity, wind speed and direction, pressure, etc. It consists of anywhere from a few hundreds to thousands of sensor nodes. The sensor node equipment includes a radio transceiver along with an antenna, a micro-controller, an interfacing electronic circuit, and an energy source, usually a battery.</td>
