	<td>A Sensor network is composed of a large number of sensor nodes that are deployed in a wide area with very low powered sensor nodes. The wireless sensor networks can be utilized in a various information and telecommunications applications. The sensor nodes are very small devices with wireless communication capability, which can collect information about sound, light, motion, temperature etc and processed different sensed information and transfers it to the other nodes.The following figure-01 illustrated the Wireless Sensor Network scenario.</td>

Each cluster has the coordinator, called Cluster head (CH). CHs are required to organize activities in the cluster like data-aggregation.</td>
